# Yu-Gi-Oh! Spooky Lair
This is a horror-themed website. It features a generator that generates a random Yu-Gi-Oh! horror monster with the click of a button (each generated monster has its own terrifying sound effect to go with it!), a gallery compiling a total of 25 Yu-Gi-Oh! horror cards, and finally, a guestbook of horrors hosted on Atabook.com for anyone who wants to leave a last message. In addition, the site also has an audio player that plays the soundtrack "Song of Unhealing" from The Legend of Zelda.
This was originally made in Neocities, and moved to GitHub. While the source code for the other sections of this Spooky Lair are availible directly in this respository, their separate respositories are below:
